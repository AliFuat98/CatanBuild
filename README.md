# CATAN

Catan is a board game designed for two to four players, involving strategic competition to gather resources and construct the most substantial settlements on the fictional island of Catan.

For more information on how to play, you can visit the following link:

I have developed a game that closely mirrors the actual Catan board game for my personal training. Starting from scratch, I painstakingly implemented all the rules found in the original Catan board game, essentially creating a replica.

If you're interested, you and your friends can enjoy the game by downloading the Git code and running the executable file. It's a great way to experience the thrill of Catan with your gaming circle.
